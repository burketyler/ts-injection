# ts-injection

`ts-injection` is an annotation based dependency injection framework written in Typescript for NodeJS apps. It enables building
applications that have loosely coupled components, resulting in:

- Easy to read code.
- Reduction in boilerplate.
- Enhanced developer experience.

:::note

Annotation vs Decorator: The correct term for the @ syntax in TypeScript/Javascript is a "decorator", in many other
languages it's referred to as an "annotation". I prefer the term annotation, so that's how I'll be referring to them in
this documentation.
