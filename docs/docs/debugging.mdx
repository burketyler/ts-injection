# Debugging

Debugging dependency injection can be difficult. Timing and execution order is
particularly important in understanding how an app using ts-injection is working
and in effectively troubleshooting issues.

Enable detailed logging using the `TSI_DEBUG` environment variable.

```shell
ts-node TSI_DEBUG=* myapp.ts
```

```typescript
process.env.TSI_DEBUG = "*";
```

## Namespaces

Debug logging can also be noisy. Logging in ts-injection uses namespaces to allow
fine-grained control over which log you need to see.

- autowire
- injection_container
- class_registry
- injectable_repo
- injectable
- env

```shell
ts-node TSI_DEBUG=autowire=*,injection_container=info
```

```typescript
process.env.TSI_DEBUG = "autowire=*,injection_container=info";
```
